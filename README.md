# HTML, CSS exercises

This repository contains exercises for learning HTML, CSS commands.

## Getting started

You will be working on a messaging application in these exercises. Follow these steps to begin working on the exercises.

### Create New Project

Create a new Project in your Git Repository, with in your Group. https://gitlab.com/siam-computing-training/gtp-3/angular/<Your Name>/

### Download and Push the repository

First, you need to create your own copy of these exercises. By downloading the Practice Project.

You need to download this [Git Repo](https://gitlab.com/siam-computing-training/gtp-3/angular/basics/practice.git) so that you have the files on your computer. Follow these steps to clone your fork. Open your Terminal and navigate to your directory for CodeYourFuture course work.

```
cd <practices>
```

Run the following command in your terminal to add your repository to your computer. Where it says `<url>`, you should paste the URL of your new project.

```
git init --initial-branch=main
git remote add origin  <url>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

Next, navigate to the repository's directory and open your code editor.

```
cd practices
code .
```

When you're done, you should see your code editor with the files open on the left, like the following screenshot.

### Set up the project

Before you can start the exercises, you must install all of the code necessary to run the exercises. Open the Terminal and run the following command.

```
npm install
```

Carefully read the messages that appear. Are there any errors? If so, please ask a mentor for help.

### Begin working on the exercises

To work on the first exercise, run the following command in the Terminal.

```
npm run 1
```

This will launch the sample website for the first exercise in your browser.

Now go back to your code editor. Open the first exercise in the `learn-1` directory and find the `readme.md` file.

Read the instructions in the file you just opened. Follow the steps to complete the exercise.

### Completing more exercises

When you have finished the first exercise, you can begin the next one. To do this, go to the Terminal and type `CTRL`+`C` to stop running the first exercise.

To run another exercise, run the following code with the correct number of that exercise:

```
npm run 2
```

## When you have completed all exercises

When you reach the final exercise, you'll be asked to submit a push to your repository. When you've finished that task, post in your Slack channel to let the mentors know that you have finished.
